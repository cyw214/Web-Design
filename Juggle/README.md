<b>Object:</b> Keep the balls from hitting the floor

<b>Game Play</b>:
  - One Click 
    * Divides single paddle causing paddle halves to gradually drift apart
    * Or, makes already divided paddle halves drift together until re-merged
  - Two Clicks
    * Causes divided paddle to snap together

<b>Challenge:</b>
  Maximize the number of bounces within a game. As more balls are introduced the speed of the divided paddle's drift
  gradually increases along with the speed of the bouncing balls.
